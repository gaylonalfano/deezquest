DeezQuest is a puzzle RPG game running in Solana Blockchain. Solana Grizzlython participant.

I started developing this project for several reasons:

1. To on-board more casual users to the Solana Ecosystem, and most importantly, to the world of Web3.
2. To encourage everybody to build in the open and to be transparent.
3. To let everyone know that Solana is capable of 100% decentralized game and has the best UX out there for blockchain-based games.
4. To support interoperability of NFTs and give more value to them by letting the players "level up" their assets.
5. To attempt cleansing the bad rep of NFT integration in games.
6. To serve as a guide for aspiring game developers who wants to try Solana.
7. Lastly, to have fun.
