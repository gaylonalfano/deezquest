DeezQuest is a puzzle RPG game running in Solana Blockchain. Solana Grizzlython participant.

I started developing this project for several reasons:

1. To on-board more casual users to the Solana Ecosystem.
2. To encourage everybody to build in the open and be transparent.
3. To let everyone know that Solana is capable of 100% fully on-chain game and has the best UX out there for blockchain-based games.
4. To support interoperability of NFTs and give more value to them by letting the players use their assets in the game.
5. To help cleansing the bad image of NFT integration in games.
6. To serve as a guide for aspiring game developers who also wants to try Solana.
7. Freedom for everyone to launch their own version of the game.
